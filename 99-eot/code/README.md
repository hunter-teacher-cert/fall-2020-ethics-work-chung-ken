# Fall 2020 Ethics Term Project (the Code)

---

## Description:

The original code is titled ***E.T. Saw e-waste***.  The program, written in Python, was meant to be a choose-your-own adventure style game used for learning/teaching about different aspects of the e-waste issue and what we can do to address those problems.  The program is built to handle multiple "stories" or perspectives on the e-waste cycle with the purpose of initiating change through educating.

The one that we have written out here is a specific point about how government regulation - specifically addressing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act - can help reduce e-waste through Right to Repair legislation.

#### Other perspectives we would like to pursue (or have students pursue) are:

* Other U.S. legislation
* Legislation outside of the U.S.
* Tech companies
* Engineers / Tech Designers
* Consumers
* Recyclers
* The U.N.
* 3rd-world recycling
* Pollution

***(Students would create a new perspectiveStory.py file modeled off of govtStory.py)***
